# Dev Log:

## Sudipta Chakraborty

### 2024-01-03 - Proposal Creation
Worked with the rest of the group to come up with the contents to PROPOSAL.md, (30m)

### 2024-01-04 - Diagram of Server and Client 
Created a diagram that distinguished the functionalities of the various parts of the project,
which was shared with the rest of the group. (1h)

### 2024-01-05 Project File Structure
Using the diagram, we decided to plan out our project file structure before writing any of the code.
This included some painful makefile debugging, work to get the different files to compile. The goal 
was to have a runnable client and server file, where each would use functions from networking.c but
also have their own respective header files, with the addition of the prompt handling files. We did
think about having dedicated C files for the logging, but decided to add it as functions in server. (30m)

### 2024-01-09 Initial Clientside Framework
Created a general idea of how the user should be able to interact with the game, focusing primarily on the
gameplay loop at first.
